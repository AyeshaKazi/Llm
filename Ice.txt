Project Idea: Automated Penetration Testing Suite using LLM for Banks

Project Description:
Develop an AI-powered system that leverages large language models (LLM) to automate the generation of test cases and scripts for penetration testing. The system will perform the following tasks:

Generate Automated Test Cases: Use LLMs to create diverse and comprehensive penetration test cases targeting various vulnerabilities within banking systems.
Generate Code for Penetration Testing: Automatically generate scripts and code snippets to execute penetration tests based on the generated test cases.
Summarize Test Results: Provide concise summaries of individual penetration test results, highlighting detected vulnerabilities and potential impacts.
Overall Activity Summary: Generate an overarching summary of all penetration testing activities, providing insights into the bank’s security posture and compliance with regulations like the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)​ (Digital Operational Resilience Act)​​ (Digital Operational Resilience Act)​.
Key Features and Benefits:

Comprehensive Testing Coverage: Ensures extensive coverage of potential vulnerabilities by automatically generating varied and in-depth test cases using advanced AI models.
Efficiency and Speed: Automates the time-consuming process of writing penetration test scripts, accelerating the overall testing process.
Regulatory Compliance: Aligns with DORA requirements by ensuring thorough and continuous assessment of digital operational resilience and cybersecurity risk management​ (Digital Operational Resilience Act)​​ (Cyber Risk GmbH)​.
Enhanced Reporting: Provides clear and actionable summaries of penetration test outcomes, enabling quick identification and remediation of security issues.
This project not only improves the efficiency and effectiveness of penetration testing but also ensures compliance with stringent regulatory standards, thus enhancing the bank’s overall cybersecurity resilience.
