Slide 1: Title Slide

"Hello, I’m PP from the GDAT team. Today, we’ll discuss our enhancements to MLflow, focusing on Inventory, Control Attestations, and Reporting. Let’s get started."

Slide 2: Need and Advantages of the Tool
"With new regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act emphasizing human rights, sustainability, transparency, and risk management, robust governance for AI and ML models is crucial. Our enhanced MLflow tool supports this by providing comprehensive visibility into AI use cases, identifying key stakeholders, and attesting to risk tiers based on business materiality and ethical considerations. It tracks all approvals and changes from registration to production, ensuring accountability. Additionally, it offers detailed reporting capabilities, including model consumption telemetry, phase-based views, and comprehensive search and audit reports."



Slide 3: Solution Overview and Features

"Our solution leverages open-source MLflow as a model repository, enhanced with multi-tenant RBAC controls, high availability, and disaster recovery capabilities. Key features include:
Design: Emulated MLflow repository for multi-tenant use with LDAP integration, RBAC controls, and HA/DR.
CICD Pipeline: Import LLMs and Embedding Models from Huggingface with mandatory tags.
Inventory and Control Attestations: Supported via CI/CD pipelines.
Tagging: Global roles for compliance, IT security, and audit to apply tags across models.
Model Deployment: Independent scalable container deployment for inference endpoints.
Model Propagation: Supports non-prod to production for traditional models.
Reporting: Export model metadata to Snowflake via StreamSets for reporting and dashboards."

Slide 4: Tags Enforcement through the SDLC/MLOps Process
Our MLflow tool enforces essential tags throughout the SDLC/MLOps process, ensuring comprehensive traceability and compliance. Starting from model registration, through development, UAT, and into production, it captures critical information at each stage.
Registration: Captures ownership, application details, and model source information.
Development: Records model configurations, documentation, and risk assessments.
UAT: Captures business sign-offs and review dates.
Production: Validates change tickets and tags application usage and approvals.
This ensures comprehensive tracking and compliance throughout the model lifecycle."


Slide 5: Critical Features of the Tool
"Our enhanced MLflow tool offers several critical features to support our needs:
Authentication: Integrates with Nomura LDAP, enhancing RBAC on artifacts.
Object Tagging: Embeds tags throughout the model lifecycle for effective inventory and controls reporting.
Model Management: Integrates with SDLC, ensuring metadata completeness and mandatory approvals through tags and aliases.
Huggingface Integration: Facilitates model downloads via a dedicated pipeline.
Disaster Recovery and High Availability: Ensures these capabilities are mandatory in production.
These features collectively enhance the robustness and reliability of our ML model management."
