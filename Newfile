Slide 2: Need and Advantages of the Tool

"With new regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act emphasizing human rights, sustainability, transparency, and risk management, robust governance for AI and ML models is crucial. Our enhanced MLflow tool supports this by providing comprehensive visibility into AI use cases, identifying key stakeholders, and attesting to risk tiers based on business materiality and ethical considerations. It tracks all approvals and changes from registration to production, ensuring accountability. Additionally, it offers detailed reporting capabilities, including model consumption telemetry, phase-based views, and comprehensive search and audit reports."



Slide 3: Solution Overview and Features

"Our solution leverages open-source MLflow as a model repository, enhanced with multi-tenant RBAC controls, high availability, and disaster recovery capabilities. Key features include:

Design: Emulated MLflow repository for multi-tenant use with LDAP integration, RBAC controls, and HA/DR.
CICD Pipeline: Import LLMs and Embedding Models from Huggingface with mandatory tags.
Inventory and Control Attestations: Supported via CI/CD pipelines.
Tagging: Global roles for compliance, IT security, and audit to apply tags across models.
Model Deployment: Independent scalable container deployment for inference endpoints.
Model Propagation: Supports non-prod to production for traditional models.
Reporting: Export model metadata to Snowflake via StreamSets for reporting and dashboards."

ML Model Inventory & Control Attestations and Reporting
Tags enforcement through the SDLC/MLOps process, additional tags can be added per new requirements
Registration
•Model.Owner
• Model. Application
•Model. Type
• Model. Source
•Business. Usecase
•Business. NIl
•Application Name*
Enforce mandatory tags at the start of model life-cycle, tracks information about the owner and model source, execute Model verification checks to certify model for enterprise grade adoption*
Development
• Model. Config
• Model Documentation
•Model Access
•Business. RiskTier
Active Development phase, model documentation and observations are recorded, application owner can share the model with other teams


UAT
•Business. SignOff
•Business. ReviewDate
Captures Business Signoffs and model review dates
Production
• SDLC.ChangeTicket
•Application. ConsumerInstance*
• Application IntendedUsage
•Application UsageApprovedBy
Change ticket validation, tag to application CMDB instance, model can be shared across use cases


Our MLflow tool enforces essential tags throughout the SDLC/MLOps process, ensuring comprehensive traceability and compliance. Starting from model registration, through development, UAT, and into production, it captures critical information at each stage. This includes verifying model readiness, documenting development, obtaining business sign-offs, and validating change tickets, thereby supporting enterprise-grade adoption and seamless integration across use cases.

Slide 4: Tags Enforcement through the SDLC/MLOps Process

"Our MLflow tool enforces different types of tags at each stage of the SDLC/MLOps process:

Registration: Captures ownership, application details, and model source information.
Development: Records model configurations, documentation, and risk assessments.
UAT: Captures business sign-offs and review dates.
Production: Validates change tickets and tags application usage and approvals.
This ensures comprehensive tracking and compliance throughout the model lifecycle."
