Integrated Cybersecurity Resilience System for Banks
Project Description:

Develop an Integrated Cybersecurity Resilience System (ICRS) that combines AI-enhanced penetration testing with automated incident response and recovery capabilities. This system will proactively identify vulnerabilities, simulate attacks, detect real-time threats, and automate response actions to enhance the bank's overall security posture and comply with regulations like the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA).

Implementation Steps:

Data Integration and Model Training:

Collect Data: Gather data from vulnerability scans, network logs, threat intelligence feeds, and historical incident reports.
Train Models: Use pre-trained models like GPT-4 and BERT, fine-tuning them with the bank's specific security data to understand context, identify vulnerabilities, and detect anomalies.
Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration Testing:

Automate Scanning: Implement AI models to automate network and application vulnerability scans.
Simulate Attacks: Use generative AI to simulate real-world attack scenarios, assessing the bank's defenses.
Generate Reports: Automatically generate detailed reports on identified vulnerabilities and suggest mitigation strategies.
Real-time Threat Detection and Analysis:

Anomaly Detection: Deploy models to analyze network traffic and user behavior in real-time, identifying suspicious activities.
Contextual Analysis: Use LLMs to correlate detected anomalies with known threats and vulnerabilities, providing contextual insights.
Automated Incident Response and Recovery:

Response Automation: Implement predefined response protocols that AI can execute automatically. For example, isolating compromised systems or blocking malicious IP addresses.
Dynamic Playbooks: Develop adaptive playbooks that AI can update based on evolving threats and incident outcomes.
Communication Automation: Use NLP models to automate communication with stakeholders during incidents, ensuring timely and clear updates.
Continuous Improvement and Feedback Loop:

Learning from Incidents: Implement a feedback loop where the system learns from each incident and updates its threat detection and response strategies.
Proactive Updates: Regularly update penetration testing scenarios and response protocols based on new threat intelligence and past incident data.
Suggested Models:

GPT-4:

For understanding and generating human-like text, useful in analyzing security reports, threat intelligence, and generating incident summaries.
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):

For tasks involving text classification, sentiment analysis, and entity recognition, essential for detecting and categorizing threats from textual data.
Custom ML Models:

Tailored models specifically trained on the bankâ€™s historical data for high-accuracy threat detection and response.
Reinforcement Learning:

To continuously optimize both penetration testing simulations and incident response strategies based on feedback.
Benefits:

Proactive Security Posture: Regularly identify and address vulnerabilities through continuous penetration testing.
Real-time Threat Mitigation: Automatically detect and respond to threats, reducing the impact of incidents.
Regulatory Compliance: Ensure compliance with regulations like DORA by maintaining robust cybersecurity practices.
Efficiency and Accuracy: Reduce manual workload on security teams, allowing them to focus on strategic tasks while improving the accuracy of threat detection and response.
By integrating these functionalities, the bank can build a resilient cybersecurity framework that not only prevents potential attacks but also swiftly responds to and recovers from any incidents, thus safeguarding its operations and customer data.
