# Sybase to Snowflake ETL System Design Document

## 1. Executive Summary

In today's data-driven world, organizations often face the challenge of migrating historical data from legacy systems to modern cloud platforms. This document outlines an intelligent and adaptable ETL architecture designed to transfer archival data from Sybase to Snowflake. Think of it as building a sophisticated highway system - we need different types of roads (processing paths) to efficiently handle different volumes of traffic (data), from quiet country lanes to busy interstate highways.

## 2. Understanding the Technical Architecture

### 2.1 The Foundation: System Components

Let's break down our architecture into logical layers, each serving a specific purpose in our data journey. Imagine these layers as different stages in a production line, each adding value to our data as it moves through the system.

#### 2.1.1 The Data Extraction Layer: Getting Data from Source

Think of this layer as our data excavation team. We need to carefully extract data from Sybase without disrupting the source system or losing any valuable information. Here's how we accomplish this:

1. Smart Connection Management:
   We implement a connection pool using HikariCP, which acts like a well-organized receptionist desk. Instead of creating new database connections for every request (which would be like hiring a new receptionist for each visitor), we maintain a pool of reusable connections. This approach significantly reduces overhead and improves performance.

   Here's why this matters:
   - Connection pools maintain 5-20 ready-to-use connections
   - If a connection fails, our system automatically attempts to reconnect using an exponential backoff strategy (like waiting longer between each attempt)
   - We implement circuit breakers that prevent system overload, similar to how electrical circuit breakers protect your home

2. Intelligent Data Retrieval:
   Different tables require different extraction strategies. For large tables, we use cursor-based pagination - think of it as reading a book chapter by chapter instead of trying to memorize the entire book at once. For complex data structures, we create materialized views that pre-package the data in a more digestible format.

#### 2.1.2 The Processing Layer: Where the Magic Happens

This is where we implement our "three-path strategy" - a custom approach for handling different data volumes efficiently. It's similar to how a city might have different types of transportation systems for different needs:

1. The Express Lane (Large Tables >100GB):
   For massive data volumes, we deploy AWS EMR on EKS, which is like having a fleet of high-speed trains working in parallel. This system can automatically scale up or down based on demand, similar to how a train service might add or remove cars based on passenger volume.

   Key Features:
   ```java
   // Example of our auto-scaling configuration
   autoscaling:
     enabled: true
     minNodes: 0
     maxNodes: "auto"  // Dynamically calculated based on data volume
     scaleUpThreshold: 70%
     scaleDownThreshold: 30%
     cooldownPeriod: 5m
   ```

2. The Middle Path (Medium Tables 1GB-100GB):
   For medium-sized datasets, we use Apache Spark on Kubernetes. Think of this as our regular bus service - more flexible than trains but still capable of handling significant loads. We optimize this path using Spark's Tungsten engine, which reorganizes data processing to take advantage of modern hardware capabilities.

3. The Local Route (Small Tables <1GB):
   For smaller tables, we use StreamSets Data Collector. This is like having a dedicated courier service - perfect for smaller, quick deliveries that don't need the overhead of larger systems.

### 2.2 Data Storage Strategy: Choosing the Right Format

Just as we choose different vehicles for different transportation needs, we select different storage formats based on data characteristics:

1. Apache Iceberg for Large Tables:
   Imagine building a library that needs to handle millions of books efficiently. Iceberg provides:
   - A smart cataloging system (schema evolution)
   - The ability to reorganize shelves without closing the library (partition evolution)
   - A detailed tracking system for every book's location and history (time travel capabilities)

2. Apache Parquet for Medium Tables:
   Think of Parquet as a highly efficient filing system. It stores data in columns rather than rows, making it perfect for analytical queries. It's like organizing a filing cabinet by categories instead of keeping everything in chronological order.

### 2.3 Quality Control and Validation

Just as a manufacturing line has quality control checkpoints, our ETL process implements multiple validation layers:

```python
# Example of our comprehensive validation approach
class DataValidator:
    def validate_completeness(self, source_data, target_data):
        """Ensures all records are transferred correctly"""
        return source_data.count() == target_data.count()

    def validate_accuracy(self, data):
        """Checks for data accuracy using business rules"""
        return all([
            self.check_value_ranges(data),
            self.verify_relationships(data),
            self.validate_calculations(data)
        ])
```
