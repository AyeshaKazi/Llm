**ETL Process Design Document: Archival Data Migration from Sybase to Snowflake**

---

## **1. Objective**
The purpose of this document is to outline the design of an ETL process responsible for migrating archival data from Sybase to Snowflake in a highly scalable and resource-efficient manner. The process should cater to varying table sizes, from very small to extremely large tables, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.

---

## **2. Requirements**
- **Data Source:** Sybase
- **Data Destination:** Snowflake
- Support both large and small tables.
- Ensure high scalability and elasticity in resource usage.
- Perform data validation after migration.
- Enable configurations for different data transfer modes (table-level, database-level).
- Minimize resource wastage and downtime.

---

## **3. Architecture Overview**
The ETL architecture consists of the following components:

1. **APIs for Data Extraction**: Interfaces to connect and fetch archival data from Sybase.
2. **Data Storage Formats**: Data is transformed into Iceberg, Avro, or Parquet formats based on performance considerations.
3. **Data Transfer Tools**: The ETL process utilizes Streamsets, AWS EMR on EKS, or Spark for data transfer depending on data size.
4. **Snowflake External Tables**: External tables in Snowflake provide efficient querying.
5. **Validation Module**: Ensures data accuracy through row counts and checksum comparisons.

## **4. High-Level Design**

### **4.1 Component Diagram**
The architecture includes the following components:

- **Sybase APIs:**
  - Reads data from Sybase.
  - Supports configurable modes: table-level or database-level extraction.

- **ETL Tools:**
  - **Streamsets:** Used for small datasets for simplicity and efficiency.
  - **AWS EMR on EKS:** Used for large datasets, providing near-serverless scaling.
  - **Apache Spark Jobs:** Employed for complex transformations and parallel processing.

- **AWS S3:**
  - Acts as an intermediate data storage for data formats (Iceberg, Avro, Parquet).
  - Supports efficient read/write operations.

- **Snowflake External Tables:**
  - Links data in AWS S3 without physically moving data into Snowflake.
  
- **Validation Service:**
  - Performs row count and checksum validations.

---

## **5. Detailed Flow**

### **5.1 Data Extraction**
- APIs connect to Sybase and fetch data based on configuration (table-level or database-level).
- API handles Sybase connection pooling and retries for resilience.

### **5.2 Data Transformation**
- Data fetched is converted to Iceberg, Avro, or Parquet format.
- **Selection Criteria:**
  - **Iceberg**: Supports versioned datasets and allows schema evolution.
  - **Parquet**: Optimized for columnar storage and fast query performance.
  - **Avro**: Used for efficient row-based storage and schema validation.

### **5.3 Data Transfer**
- **Small Tables:** Streamsets handles the data ingestion directly from Sybase to Snowflake.
- **Large Tables:**
  - Data is moved via AWS S3 buckets using EMR clusters.
  - EMR on EKS provides dynamic scaling:
    - **Scale Up:** Scales up rapidly for large tables.
    - **Scale Down:** Scales down to zero during idle periods to save resources.

### **5.4 Snowflake External Table Creation**
- External tables are created in Snowflake, referencing the data stored in S3.
- Allows querying without copying data into Snowflake storage, improving speed and cost-efficiency.

### **5.5 Post-Process Validation**
- **Row Count Validation:** Compares the number of records in Sybase and Snowflake.
- **Checksum Validation:** Computes checksums for data verification.
- **Error Handling:** Logs any discrepancies and sends alerts for manual inspection.
